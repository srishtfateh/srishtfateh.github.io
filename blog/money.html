      What is money?
    </h1>

    <p style="margin-top:20px">

        We all are familiar with the most common use case of money: it is a store of value and medium of exchange. At least that is what Economics 101 taught us. But today, we want to answer the following questions: What does money mean in today’s world? How has it evolved with time? What are the properties of money?
    </p>
    <p>

I would like to answer the above three questions starting from the last one. Money can be any entity that has an underlying consensus of belief and acceptance from a large number of people. The reason for this consensus can vary, but in every case, such a consensus exists in some form and gives value to money. Moreover, the size and quality (something again dependent on human beliefs) of the underlying population decides the confidence that one has in a certain form of money.
</p>
<p>
Let us now dive deeper into some of the properties that have gained the consensus of the human population for money. Such properties, later on, became “monetary” value. 
    
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Scarcity:</strong> Natural resources such as shells, pearls, jewels, etc are created by mother nature (at least until 500 years ago). Moreover, unlike other rocks and sand, these resources are much scarce in nature. The scarcity of such materials is pretty evident to any human. Therefore, humans gathered an unsaid consensus on the fact that these materials are scarce.

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Usefulness, resourcefulness, and technology:</strong> Entities such as land, sheep, water are known to humans to provide usefulness in day-to-day lives. Such common knowledge led humans to land on a consensus about the uses of such resources. Some resources such as iron or copper are not useful directly to large populations however, there are intermediary institutions that process such materials and create a useful product for large masses. In this case, the consensus for the resourcefulness of copper and iron is delegated to some central institutions by a large number of people (called customers).

    </li>
<li>
    <strong>Representation of a community:</strong> This is one of the most important and powerful concepts to understand money these days. Gold was used as a medium of exchange until paper money was introduced. Paper money or artificial money has been usually backed by a commodity that is scarce or resourceful, however, the most important value in paper money is the signature of the government. If we dig deeper and ask what exactly is a government, the answer is that government is an institution that represents its population. Essentially, social consensus gives rise to institutions called governments, governments give their signature on a piece of paper which eventually gives value to coins, notes, and bills.

</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Now, we know sufficient tools to calculate the monetary value of an object: scarcity, usefulness, acceptance by the population, and size of the population independently increase the monetary value of an object.
</p>
<h2>Difference between wealth and money:</h2>
<p>
     Personally, I believe that wealth is a conventional notion of money. Wealth is derived from well-being i.e. wealth is the old notion of money. If we look back at the factors that affect the value of an object, we can find that the first and second factors are intuitive and natural to the human mind whereas the third factor is artificial or man-made. Anything that is scarce or useful can be considered as wealth such as land, gold, cars whereas anything that is valuable because it represents a community is generally considered to be currency and not wealth. However, since wealth is a subset of money (it shares the first two factors of values), wealth also means money.

</p>

<h2>
    Can money be created out of thin air?

</h2>

<p>
    Nowadays, many people are confused about the new forms of money such as stocks, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, etc and they wonder whether money can be generated out of thin air?  The answer is an absolute yes. Let's try to investigate whether we can generate any one of the above three properties out of thin air.


</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Scarcity: By definition, if something is scarce means that no one can generate more quantities of it. Therefore, this property is fixed forever. But some of you might wonder that the monetary value of bitcoin is attributed to scarcity and this coin was created out of thin air. You are only partially correct and we will discuss this later.

    </li>
<li>
    Resourcefulness and technology: We humans have been working tirelessly since the industrial revolution first started to build technology and resources not just for an individual but for the whole society, not just for today but for 100 years in the future. But where is the monetary value of all the resources that we built? Well, part of the monetary resources has gone into the actual physical resource such as metal, factories, end products, etc and the rest of the monetary value (which represents the majority of total value) has been accumulating into the technology. One way in which we have created money out of this technology is by creating stocks for the businesses that use it.

</li>
<li>
    Representation of the community: It is easier to understand how this property can be generated out of thin air. We just need something that securely represents a community. For example, take stocks. Each stock represents its underlying business which not just consists of the technology and resources that it owns but also the consumers that it affects. Another interesting example is bitcoin which represents the consensus of miners who verify the sanctity of its distribution and the coin holders who believe in this coin. Note that bitcoin doesn’t have value just because of its scarcity. Even if Bitcoin had an inflation rate of 50% p.a., it would still have some monetary value (no matter how meager). This is because bitcoin represents more than just its community. Being the first cryptocurrency, it also represents (to some extent) the technology behind it. And lastly, it also represents its resourcefulness in being a medium of exchange. But do we know some entity that has very little of the first two properties (scarcity and resourcefulness) and is dependent solely on the third property (representation of its community)? The answer to this is meme coin. Yes, meme coins like Dogecoin do have real monetary value and people like Elon Musk can leverage the power of Twitter to create real monetary value out of thin air by strengthening the consensus of a large community by making them believe that the coin has a loyal community. Yes, there is positive feedback here (sometimes called a Ponzi scheme) but what isn’t a Ponzi scheme in this world! (To be discussed later).
</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope that you have now a better understanding of money. Let us see what other properties of money are discovered by humans after the introduction of cryptocurrencies.
